    <h1>EVALUATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCREASED SCREEN TIME AND ADHD IN CHILDREN</h1>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Dependency on digital devices, noted by an increase in daily screen time, has been argued as the cause of several poor physical and mental health developments. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one such mental disorder in children, resulting in inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The escalating prevalence of screen time amongst children and adolescents has raised concerns regarding its role in the development of ADHD.</p>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> This systematic review aims at critically evaluating pre-existing evidence on the correlation between increased screen time and ADHD development in children and adolescents.</p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>A systematic search was conducted on PubMed and Cochrane databases for Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies published between 2000 and 2020. The search was limited to symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents exposed to higher durations of screen time. Data were extracted on study design, sample characteristics, screen time interventions, and ADHD symptomatology outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>

    <p>The review incorporated data from 6 studies comparing the impact of screen time, including recreational and educational uses of electronic devices, on ADHD symptoms among children aged 3-18 years. Most studies demonstrated a significant adverse effect of increased screen time on hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention, though others showed no substantial impact. All studies included over 60,000 participants, with an average of 1.5 hours of daily screen time. In 5 out of 6 studies, longer screen time durations were associated with a higher prevalence of ADHD symptoms (95% confidence interval). Variability in findings was attributed to differences in screen time duration, type of screen activity, and age of the child.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The association between increased screen time and ADHD symptom presentation indicates a consistent correlation between higher levels of screen exposure and heightened ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents.</p>
